For the ETL mini project, we worked as a team of four to practice building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, Python dictionary methods and regular expressions to extract and transform the data. After we transformed the data, we created four CSV files and used the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, we uploaded the CSV file data into a Postgres database.

We made sure to divide the work, it was essential to collaborate and communicate while working on different parts of the project and checked in regularly and for support.

## **Prep Work**
1. One group member created a new repository and named it <code>Crowdfunding_ETL</code> and added the other team members as collaborators.
2. We each cloned the new repository to our computers.
3. We had one person rename the <code>ETL_Mini_Project_starter_code.ipynb</code> file with the first name initial and last name of each member of the group. Then, added this Jupyter notebook file and the Resources folder containing the <code>crowdfunding.xlsx</code> and the <code>contacts.xlsx</code> files to our repository and pushed the changes to GitHub.
4. Then, each team member pulled the changes, so all of us would have the same notebook available on our computer.
5. As we worked through the project deliverables, we broke up the work across other notebooks that each of us worked on individually. Once complete, we combined all the subsections back into the final ETL_Mini_Project notebook.
